MilSim City is Utah's premier indoor airsoft arena. The 40,000 square foot indoor city was built for players of all ages and skills to enjoy military simulation games in a fun, safe, and exciting environment.

Airsoft is for everyone at MilSim City. Law enforcement agencies, military operators, and civilians can test and hone their close quarter battle (CQB) skills. Families and groups can enjoy a unique, active experience that encourages team work, communication, strategizing, and healthy competition. Companies can schedule a team building event that fosters leadership skills, builds camaraderie, and challenges players physically and intellectually.

Walk-ins are welcome during all public hours. Private events can be scheduled up to 48 hours in advance and are held during non-public hours.

We seek to foster and maintain relationships with special operations personnel, law enforcement departments, tactical instructors, tactical equipment companies, and airsoft suppliers in order to provide the highest quality of instruction, training, and equipment possible. Give us a call so we can start building a relationship with you and your business!
